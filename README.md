# todo-quiz-app-mobile-app-development-portfolio2

This is the second portfolio assignment from Mobile App Development! Applying and showing off my skills about what I learned in the class in the final days of the Spring semester and how did I apply it here!

# Here are the changes that I have done for this portfolio assignment!

I've chosen (Option 1.1) for this portfolio assignment!

This work was done previously in Lab 7, in which I had to use React and React Native Elements to create a TO-DO List.

I have added a second Checkbox section moreso on the questions side. This can be used for quizzes, interviews, meetings, etc. 

Despite the fact that there are a majority of similarites regarding this and the TO-DO App, the most vital part of creating a second Checkbox is to understand the different arrays, arrow functions, and elements that have been implemented to make this work!

The work to create these different features are in the App.js file.
